The sample project for Atmel SAM3X is prepared to run on
an Atmel SAM3X-EK eval board, but may be used on other target
hardware as well.
Using different target hardware may require modifications.

Configurations:

- Debug:
  This configuration is prepared for download into internal
  Flash using J-Link. An embOS debug and profiling library is

  To use SEGGER SystemView with this configuration, configure
  SystemViewer for ATSAM3X8H as target device and SWD at
  2000 kHz as target interface.
