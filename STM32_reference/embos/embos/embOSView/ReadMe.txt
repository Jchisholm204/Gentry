embOS is also shipped with a J-Link DLL located in the embOSView
directory. embOSView automatically loads the J-Link DLL located
in the same directory as the executable. If such a DLL does not
exist, it will search for a J-Link DLL installed by the J-Link
Software and Documentation Pack. In order to use another J-Link
DLL replace or delete the DLL in the directory of the embOSView
executable.
